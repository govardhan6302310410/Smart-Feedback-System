# **Realtime Feedback System for Events**

## **Project Overview**

The **Realtime Feedback System** is a real-time platform designed to collect and analyze feedback from event attendees. It allows participants to submit their thoughts quickly and anonymously during or after an event. This solution provides event organizers with instant insights to improve the event experience, making it more interactive and engaging for everyone involved.

## **Key Features**

- **Room Code System**: Each event or session is assigned a unique room code, allowing attendees to easily join and submit feedback.
  
- **Anonymous Usernames**: Attendees are given random, anonymous usernames like "Tactile Bunny" or "Demo Tortoise" to ensure privacy and encourage honest feedback.
  
- **Real-time Feedback Collection**: Feedback is submitted instantly and displayed in real-time, allowing event organizers to make immediate adjustments if needed.
  
- **Multiple Feedback Types**: The system supports various feedback formats including star ratings, text responses, multiple-choice questions, and emoji reactions.
  
- **Live Insights & Analytics**: Organizers can view live visualizations and summaries of feedback, such as trends and sentiments, to make data-driven decisions.
  
- **Customizable Feedback Forms**: Organizers can customize the feedback types and questions for different sessions or events.
  
- **Simple & Mobile-Friendly Interface**: The platform is accessible on any device, ensuring attendees can easily provide feedback without the need for app downloads or registrations.
  
- **Post-Event Reports**: Generates detailed reports summarizing feedback, trends, and insights for future event planning.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for UI/UX)
  - Bootstrap for responsive design

- **Backend**:
  - Firebase for real-time database management and user authentication

- **Other Tools**:
  - Room code generation and feedback processing using JavaScript and Firebase functions.

## **How It Works**

2. **Attendee Feedback**: Attendees enter the room code on the platform and are assigned an anonymous username.
  
3. **Feedback Submission**: Attendees submit feedback using various formats like ratings, text responses, and emoji reactions.
  
4. **Real-time Data Processing**: Feedback is processed instantly and visualized in real-time for the organizer to view.
  
5. **Post-Event Reports**: After the event, organizers can download detailed reports summarizing the feedback.

## **Future Improvements**
